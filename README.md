### Building AI-native enterprise software | CS @ CU Boulder & Euro-FH

Trying to make enterprise software suck less. Currently deep in AI agents, multi-tenant architecture, and questioning my life choices at 2am.

## What I'm actually doing

Co-founding **MambaHR** - we're building HR software that doesn't make you want to quit your job. Think chat interface instead of clicking through endless dropdowns.

Previously was Product Owner at a major Swiss Bank working on data mesh architecture and CRM systems. Somehow also finishing two CS degrees simultaneously because sleep is overrated.

**Right now:**
- 🤖 Building AI agents that actually understand context (harder than it sounds)
- 🏗️ Architecting multi-tenant SaaS systems that scale
- 🎨 Obsessing over UI details 
- 📝 Writing technical papers
- ☕ Consuming unhealthy amounts of coffee

## Projects worth mentioning

### 🐍 MambaHR
AI-native HRIS with chat-first interface. Multi-tenant architecture, semantic search with pgvector, hybrid integration strategy with major HR platforms. Liquid Glass UI aesthetic because enterprise software can actually look good.

**Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI, PostgreSQL  
**Status:** Phase 1 MVP in development

---

### 💼 PetCarePro
Built a full multi-tenant CRM for pet care professionals. Complete auth system, scheduling, client management. This was my "figure out SaaS architecture" project before scaling MambaHR.

**Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind  
**Learning:** Row-level security is fun until it's not

---

### 📊 Data Mesh @ ZKB
Bachelor thesis that actually made it to production. Decentralized data architecture for a major Swiss bank. Domain-driven approach to data products.

**Stack:** Microservices, Distributed Systems, BGP  
**Impact:** Running in production, enabling domain-owned analytics

---

### 🎯 Side Projects
Various career tools (Montio, job search platforms), networking labs with BGP and containerlab, too many React components that probably didn't need to exist, and countless hours tweaking animations.

## My take on things

Most enterprise software feels stuck in 2005. AI isn't just about adding chatbots - it's a chance to completely rethink interfaces. Natural language should be the default, not a feature.

I care more about building things that work than following trends. Clean architecture > clever hacks. User experience > feature count.

Also: if your enterprise software needs a manual, you've already lost.

## Let's talk

Always down to discuss:
- AI agents and making them actually useful (not just glorified autocomplete)
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture 
- Why enterprise UX is generally terrible
- The future of HR tech (hot take: it needs a complete rewrite)
- How to run a startup while finishing two degrees (answer: barely)

**Open for:** Technical partnerships · Investor conversations · Coffee · Debates about best coding practices
