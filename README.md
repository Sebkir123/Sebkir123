I design systems where AI and enterprise infrastructure intersect. My work lives in the gap between research-grade ML and production-grade engineering — building things that scale, stay consistent under load, and degrade gracefully when they don't.

Previously: principal architecture on a data mesh platform at a **$600B+ Swiss cantonal bank** — decomposed a monolithic data estate into domain-owned data products, redesigned governance as a federated control plane, and shipped it to production across thousands of internal users.

Currently building **MambaHR** — rethinking the HR software interface layer from scratch.

CS @ CU Boulder (M.S.) + Euro-FH Hamburg (B.S.)

### Engineering focus

| | |
|---|---|
| **AI agent systems** | Orchestration layers for multi-step agentic workflows: context windows, memory management, tool routing, failure recovery. Not demos — systems that hold up when the model is wrong. |
| **Semantic retrieval** | Hybrid search pipelines combining dense vector retrieval (pgvector) with sparse BM25 ranking. Embedding model selection, chunking strategy, retrieval eval. |
| **Distributed data architecture** | Data mesh, domain-oriented data products, federated governance. Designed the ownership model, not just the pipeline. |
| **Enterprise integration layer** | High-reliability webhook infrastructure, idempotency, backpressure handling, API versioning strategy across heterogeneous upstream systems. |
| **LLM in production** | Latency/cost tradeoffs across model tiers, prompt caching, structured output validation, eval frameworks for non-deterministic systems. |

### Writing & research

Published on **privacy-preserving workforce analytics**, **algorithmic fairness in people systems**, and **taxonomies for enterprise AI agent architectures**. I write to sharpen thinking, not to publish — but some of it ends up as papers.
